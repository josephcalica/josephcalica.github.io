# Oregon State University Robotics Club (OSURC): Underwater ROV

<img src="images/ROV.jpg?raw=true"/>

## __Project Description__: 

The OSURC Underwater ROV team is a collaborative multi-disciplinary team that focuses on constructing a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The ROV is intended for use in the [MATE ROV Competition](http://www.materovcompetition.org/aboutmateii) where teams use their ROV to perform simulated oceanic/environmental maintenance tasks. The team is composed of four different sub-teams including Business, Electrical, Mechanical and Software Engineering students.  

## __Role & Results__:

Through my +2 years as a member of the ROV team __as a Mechanical Design Specialist I designed, prototyped, developed and fabricated the clubs first functional manipulator__ for use in an underwater environment. The manipulator was designed in __SOLIDWORKS__ with an intended use case of __underwater pick-and-place / rotary manipulation__.

In addition to my responsibilities as a mechanical design specialist some of my other responsibilities / accomplishments in the team included:

* Reverse-engineering and Fabricating Waterproof Electrical Cable Connections
* Water-proofing various electrical components (i.e. Servos and Wires)
* Mentoring Junior Members upon 3D Printing, Design-For-Manufacture and SOLIDWORKS
