# Applied Robotics: Cornhole Playing Robot

<img src="images/Everything.JPG?raw=true"/>

## __Project Description__: 

For the Spring term of Oregon State's Applied Robotics course, three person teams of Electrical, Mechanical and Software Engineering students were tasked with developing a small mobile robot that could play Cornhole. During rounds, the robot competed "hands-off" meaning that the robot had to complete its task either autonomously or by being tele-operated out the sight of the operator.

## __Role & Results__:

As the Mechanical Engineering student on my team, my deliverables included the design and constuction of the following programmable mehcanisms:
* Throwing mechanism which could quickly, consistently and accurately throw a beanbag toward the cornhole board
* Mobile base which allowed the robot to aim the throwing mechanism and drive to the other side of the field
* Bean bag reloader that could hold the two extra bean bags needed for competing in a cornhole round

Luckily I didn't need to make a mobile base becuase my team had access to a Pioneer 3-DX robot which can easily be teleoperated via SSH control of a mobile computer like the Intel NUC equipped with ROS and plugged in to the 3-DX.

For the throwing mechanism, I opted to make a pneumatic catapult because pneumatic systems are consistnent, possess high-power density and can easily be controlled with an Arduino. Images of the prototype and final catapult system can be found below.

To reload the catapult, I designed a simple servo-actuated carriage that can hold two bean bags and reload them into the catapult when needed.

The catapult and reloader were both designed in SOLIDWORKS using 80/20 as the main construction material because it is strong, modular and easy to assemble.
