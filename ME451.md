# Sensors & Microcontrollers: Infrared Light Chasing Robot

<img src="images/Bot_Final.jpg?raw=true"/>

## __Project Description__: 

For ME-451, Oregon State's introductory course to sensors and microcontrollers, students were tasked with developing a robot that could detect an infrared (IR) light and navigate toward the light autonomously. Teams were given a 2 month timeline and a barebones pre-built chassis to focus upon the sensors and coding portion of the project. 

## __Role & Results__:

Having the most experience with robotics in my team I took on the role of team lead which required the distillation of the ambiguous "make it find IR lights" goal into clear end-goals and deliverables for my team-mates.

Beyond the parameterization the project lifecycle, my deliverables also included the following:

* Designing the robots navigation code to navigate to an IR light source using an L298N motor driver and IR sensor data
* Designing a crude encoder wheel for use in course-correction of robot navigation and state-estimation
* Assisting teammates in troubleshooting/debugging their mission components (i.e. sensors noise, under/over actuation, code reviews, circuitry issues, etc.)
* Serving as the team ambassador in communicating team concerns/question with our TAs and Professor
* Scheduling team-meetings
